GTKSPICE
Sam Gallagher 2017-2019

This is a proper implementation of SPICE with the GTK toolkit to compete with the Windows-only LTSpice. 

It runs on gtkmm and uses ngspice as a backend (not yet implemented). I'm constantly learning new things and use
this project to test design patterns etc so progress can be twisty. But hopefully one day we can have an
open-source alternative to LTSpice and others.
