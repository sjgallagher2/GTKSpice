Example of an LTSpice Schematic:
/******* DRAFT1.ASC *******/
  Version 4
  SHEET 1 880 680
  SYMBOL res 96 64 R0
  SYMATTR InstName R1
  SYMBOL res 208 64 R90
  WINDOW 0 0 56 VBottom 2
  WINDOW 3 32 56 VTop 2
  SYMATTR InstName R2
  SYMBOL res 288 64 R90
  WINDOW 0 0 56 VBottom 2
  WINDOW 3 32 56 VTop 2
  SYMATTR InstName R3
  SYMBOL res 352 192 R180
  WINDOW 0 36 76 Left 2
  WINDOW 3 36 40 Left 2
  SYMATTR InstName R4
/**************************/

SHEET means the sheet we're on, SYMBOL is a component symbol, SYMATTR is a symbol attribute,
WINDOW is an attribute window showing some attribute as text. When a value is added to a symbol,
a SYMATTR is added to the schematic. When no components are on the schematic, only Version and
SHEET are in the file. When one resistor is added, we get a SYMBOL and SYMATTR.

When wires are added, we get a WIRE for each segment. When a resistor is rotated, we get 
a WINDOW with VBottom alignment and a WINDOW with VTop alignment for the attribute windows
on that resistor (this just pushes the text around). These appear after the SYMBOL.
