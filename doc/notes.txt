There are two control "knobs" for the user: the mouse and the keyboard. 

For mouse left-click, the active tool handles the click. For scrolling,
the canvas assumes control and simply scrolls. For right-clicking, we need
to bring up a context menu, which will depend on the active tool and the
current selection. For middle-click, there's no defined behavior yet. 
Left clicks must also check for modifiers, but this hasn't been implemented
yet. 

For the keyboard, things are slightly more involved. Users typically want
to customize their keyboard shortcuts to something that suits them. This
means we need a lot of configuration. We'll just need to have a way to 
bind keys to different actions. 

There's something of an issue with context. We'll see.
